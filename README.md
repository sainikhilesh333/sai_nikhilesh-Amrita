This repository is created to showcase the project done with the workshop conducted by CESA I2IT

At the End of the workshop, we would have built a chatbot using IBM watson for a Electronic store.

It can answer questions regarding information about the store, location, list of items in store etc

The chatbot is trained on a user manual for the electronic store, with the help of IBM discovery, and this is integrated with the IBM watson assistant with the help of Webhooks in the Node Red.

This makes the chatbot answer question asked from the manual eg) how to turn on heater?

The chatbot has a registeration page, a login apge, a query page, customer help page.

The overall flow of the project is as follows, start with IBM cloud account, explore Node Red, Explore Watson assistant, explore IBM Discovery, Webhooks and finally deploy the chatbot.
